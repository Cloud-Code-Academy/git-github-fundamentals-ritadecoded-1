# Github 101 - Feedback

I've dabbled with github in the past for a few projects. I'm familiar with repositories, communities, and markdown. This is my second profile since I had no idea what I was doing previously. Well, it's safe to say that'll change. 

What I learned:
* Branches
* Forks
* Issues 

Going more into depth about those topics helped me understand how to better delegate workflow.

_I'm a **hands-on/visual learner** so I operate best by doing. I've watched some more tutorials and will gain more understanding of the platform once I create more repositories and practice._
